notebooks initiate with warning:
WARNING:param.main: pandas could not register all extension types imports failed with the following error: cannot import name 'ABCIndexClass' from 'pandas.core.dtypes.generic' (/srv/conda/envs/notebook/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pandas/core/dtypes/generic.py)

All notebooks otherwise execute properly.

On server param 1.11.1, pandas 1.3.0
panel 0.11.3
When I used binder terminal and imported holoviews, I got the above error.
holoviews 1.14.4
python 3.7.10

This is a very fresh error so it should get fixed soon. Make sure once it's fixed that the binder repository is refreshed.
