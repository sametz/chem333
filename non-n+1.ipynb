Note the height of the signal (an approximation of its total area) is now 1. In the absence of any splitting, this proton will only resonate at this one frequency, and its integration would be normalized as 1 H.\n",

These distances, in Hz, will be two coupling constants. In the dd case, this completes the analysis--the two splittings can be measured as 3 and 7 Hz, and the center of the signal (in ppm) would be the chemical shift. \n",
