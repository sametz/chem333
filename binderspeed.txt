Logging time taken to launch binder in various configs.

2021-06-19
==========
Initial launch: 1:41
However: Sparse dot product was causing error. Opened issues at sparse GitHub.
The current CHEM333 conda environment uses sparse 0.9.1 and works.
Sparse 0.11 binder failed. Sparse 0.12 failed.
Sparse 0.10 worked.
