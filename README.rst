UNDER CONSTRUCTION
==================

Currently there is one useful Jupyter notebook for CHEM333: non-n+1.ipynb

The easiest way to use the notebook is to click the "launch binder" icon
above. There will be a loading animation displayed, with a facsimile of a
file directory beneath. When the loading animation is done, you should be
left with a functioning file directory. Clicking on "non-n+1.ipynb" should
launch the Jupyter notebook in a new browser tab.

In the notebook, from the drop-down menu select "Run All" from the "Cell"
dropdown menu at the top of the page. This will run all the code in the
notebook and generate interactive NMR plots. The tutorial includes directions
for how to manipulate the plots and observe the results.

Feel free to change parameters, or even the visible code, to see what
happens--you can't break anything. If you need to restore a simulation to the
initial slider settings, you can click inside the code cell above the plot
and hit shift-return to re-load it. If you want to reload the entire
notebook (e.g. you accidentally typed in a code block and don't know how to
fix it), select "Restart & Run All" from the "Kernel" menu.

If you are already familiar with Jupyter notebooks, you can of course
download the files and run them on your own computer. The requirements.txt
has the list of necessary Python packages. Python 3.6 was used for the
project, but other Python 3 installations may work. It's strongly recommended
to use a virtual environment (or, if you use a conda/Anaconda installation,
a conda environment) for this.
