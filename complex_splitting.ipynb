    "\n",
    "When $J >> \\Delta \\nu$ (the chemical shift difference in Hz, not ppm), the pattern resembles two doublets. As the chemical shift difference becomes smaller, distortions appear. First, the inner peaks of this 4-peak signal grow larger as the outer peaks grow smaller. {In general, protons that are coupled show a \"leaning towards each other) effect like this that increases as the chemical shift difference decreases.} Second, the chemical shift of each proton is not exactly in the middle of the doublet, and as the two signals approach each other in chemical shift this difference becomes more pronounced.\n",

    "- In the interactive plot below, note that when $\\nu_1$ (v1) = 150 Hz (an arbitrary chemical shift in Hz, not ppm) and $\\nu_2$ (v2) = 50 Hz, the pattern resembles two doublets. The chemical shift difference (100 Hz) is much larger than the coupling (10 Hz), and the distortion is minimal--slight leaning of the signals toward each other, and the midpoints of the \"doublets\" being very close to 150 and 50 Hz.\n",

Above and to the right of the plot is a toolbar. If you select the \"zoom\" tool and zoom in on the AB quartet, you can see that the midpoint of each doublet is now far off from 110 Hz / 90 Hz. The \"true\" chemical shifts (110 and 90 Hz) are much closer to the larger, inner peak than the smaller, outer peak. This means that, to calculate the exact chemical shift of each signal, a more sophisticated calculation is required (see: __[this page](https://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/nmr/05-hmr-10-ax-ab.htm)__ under \"5-HMR-10.4 Solving an AB pattern\" if you're interested)."
